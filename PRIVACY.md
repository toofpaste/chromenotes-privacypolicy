# Simple Notes 98 Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 2025-11-10_

Simple Notes 98 is designed to keep your information on your device. This policy explains what data the extension accesses, how i
s stored, and the limited circumstances under which it may be removed.

## Data the extension processes
- **Notes, folders, and drawings** that you create inside the popup or floating overlay.
- **Images** that you paste, upload, or annotate within a note.
- **Extension preferences** such as overlay visibility, default docking position, window size, and drawing tool settings.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** that you configure through the Chrome Extensions shortcuts page.

No other personal data is accessed. Simple Notes 98 does not read or collect data from the webpages you visit beyond the text you e
xplicitly send using the context menu capture feature.

## Where data is stored
All data is stored locally using the Chrome Extensions `chrome.storage.local` API. The extension does not use remote databases,
 cloud services, or analytics providers. Because everything resides within your browser profile, uninstalling the extension or 
clearing browser storage will delete your notes.

## How data is used
The extension only reads your stored data to render notes, drawings, images, and preferences within the popup, overlay, and opti
ons page. Data is never transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.

## Network access
Simple Notes 98 does not make network requests for note content, preferences, or usage analytics. The extension only loads bundled
 assets and optional icon files that you supply.

## Data control
You can delete notes, folders, images, and drawings at any time from within the interface. Removing the extension from Chrome or
 clearing `chrome.storage.local` will permanently erase all stored information.

If you have questions about privacy or need assistance with data removal, please open an issue in the project repository.
